# Design-and-Implementation-of-a-GaN-Based-Half-Bridge-Gate-Driver-Module
Designed a GaN-based half-bridge driver using Si8271 gate drivers and GS61008P GaN FETs with isolated
power supplies for each leg. Implemented high-speed, low-inductance layout principles for efficient switching
and noise minimization.
